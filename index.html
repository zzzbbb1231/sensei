        <h2>SenseiBA the Name</h2>
        <p>
	     It shares the same name with its parent project <a href="http://senseidb.com">SenseiDB</a>. 
</p>
		<p>        
Sensei (先生) means teacher or professor in Japanese (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensei">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensei</a>).
	 	</p>
		<p>It has the same pronunciation and writing as the Chinese word.
        </p>

        <h2>What makes it different from other OLAP solutions?</h2>
        <p>
	      It can store several billions documents in memory on a single machine with 64 RAM. We all know that hitting the disk is expensive. 
             It takes several milliseconds per a disk seek and that kills the performance. That's why we've made a conscious decision 
            to achieve best possible index compression, so that we can do the index scan in RAM even for a huge dataset. 
            At the same time it's based on the search oriented database and is extremely fast. LinkedIn engineers spend several years to achieve stability and best possible performance for the SenseiDB. 
            And SenseiBA inherits all those cool features

        <h2>BQL</h2>
        <p>
        	Browse Query Language (BQL) is an SQL-like language used to to interface with Sensei.
        </p>
		<p>
			Example BQL:
			<pre class="prettyprint lang-bql">
  select sum(ArrDelay), avg (DepDelay) 
     from Flights 
     where UniqueCarrier = 'US' group by Dest
</pre>

	  <div class="span5">
        <h2>Clients</h2>
        <p>
        	Client libraries to interact with SenseiDB programmatically. e.g.:
 			<ul>
				<li><a href="client-rest.html">Rest</a></li>
				<li><a href="client-java.html">Java</a></li> 
				<li><a href="client-python.html">Python</a></li>

	  <div class="span5">
        <h2>What SenseiBA isn't?</h2>
        <p>
        	SenseiBA doesn't support transactions. It is suitable for append only updates and doesn't offer data mutability. In order to achieve index compression and store 10x more docs per node we had to get rid of Lucene, that's why SenseiBA doesn't support full text search and real time indexing. Although the last one can be achieved by taken hybrid approach and deploying SenseiDb and SenseiBA in the same cluster. In our roadmap we have a plan to implement realtime indexing for the project.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="span6">
        <h2>Hadoop integration</h2>
        <p>
        	Ideally indexes are computed externally (in most cases in Hadoop) and pushed to the SenseiBA via the rest interface
        </p>
        <p>
            SenseiBA offers the ability to bootstrap from data in HDFS via a built-in Map-reduce indexing job. This can be a very appealing for a wide-variety of data-warehousing applications.
