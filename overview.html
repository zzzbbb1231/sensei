		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			SenseiBA is the distributed OLAP datastore based on <a href="http://www.senseidb.com">SenseiDB</a> project. It leverages highly compressed columnar indexes to support realtime search and aggregation on huge datasets.
		</p>
	</p>

<h3>What makes it different from other OLAP solutions?</h3>
<p>
  It can store several billions documents in memory on a single machine with 64 RAM. We all know that hitting the disk is expensive. 
It takes several milliseconds per a disk seek and that kills the performance. 
That's why we've made a conscious decision to achieve best possible index compression, so that we can do the index scan in RAM even for a huge dataset. 
At the same time it's based on the search oriented database and is extremely fast. LinkedIn engineers spend several years to achieve stability and best possible performance for the SenseiDB.
 And SenseiBA inherits all those cool features
</p>
<h3>How stable is it?</h3>
<p>
  Currently at LinkedIn we have 2 production deployments. Moreover it shares 85% of the codebase with SenseiDB. Instances of SenseiDB and SenseiBA can be deployed in the same cluster interchangeably. These two databases share the same api, cluster management and monitoring. In fact it's the same SenseiDB with modified foundations. As for the SenseiDB, it has been used at LinkedIn for a several years on many projects. It proved to be reliable and fast. We have several hundred Sensei nodes serving in production.
</p>
<h3>What SenseiBA isn't?</h3>
<p>
  SenseiBA doesn't support transactions. It is suitable for append only updates and doesn't offer data mutability. In order to achieve index compression and store 10x more docs per node we had to get rid of Lucene, that's why SenseiBA doesn't support full text search and real time indexing. Although the last one can be achieved by taken hybrid approach and deploying SenseiDb and SenseiBA in the same cluster. In our roadmap we have a plan to implement realtime indexing for the project.

<h3>Index compression</h3>
<p>
  The goal of the project is to achieve smallest  possible memory footprint, while keeping queries to be fast

<h3>How indexing works?</h3>
<p>
  Ideally indexes are computed externally (in most cases in Hadoop) and pushed to the SenseiBA via the rest interface.
